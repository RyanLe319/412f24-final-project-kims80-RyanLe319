## User Guide

# Home Page Features
The Home Page provides three main features for navigating and interacting with the Smithsonian's virtual collection: Search, Term, and Favorite.

1. Search
The Search feature allows users to perform a broad search across the collection. Users can choose a general category (such as Art, History, etc.), and input keywords related to what they are looking for. The results will be displayed in a Lazy Stagger Grid, showcasing relevant artifacts based on the search query. This feature is ideal for users who wish to explore a wide range of artifacts within a specific category.

2. Term
The Term feature provides a more refined search experience. After selecting a broad category, users can choose from a comprehensive list of subterms or detailed terms. Once a subterm is selected, the results will be populated in the Lazy Stagger Grid, allowing users to view artifacts that match the more specific criteria. This feature helps users narrow down their search based on precise attributes or classifications.

3. Favorite
The Favorite feature allows users to save artifacts they find interesting. After viewing an artifact, users can click the Favorite button to save it to their personal collection. These favorites will then be accessible in the Favorite page, where users can easily review and revisit their saved artifacts.

# Settings and Customization
On the Home Page, there is a Settings button that provides users with the ability to customize their viewing experience. From the settings menu, users can switch between Light and Dark themes to match their preferred style or environment.

Additionally, users have the option to select a Custom Theme. This theme can be personalized using a color palette that was specifically designed for the application, offering users a unique and tailored interface that suits their preferences.

# Artifact Details
When a user clicks on any artifact displayed in the Lazy Stagger Grid, detailed information about the artifact will appear. This includes the Title, Date, and Author (if available), providing users with in-depth context about the artifact they are exploring.
